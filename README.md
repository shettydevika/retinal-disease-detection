# **Retinal OCT Image Classification using DenseNet**

---

## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on **Retinal OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) Image Classification** using the **DenseNet** architecture. OCT imaging is an essential tool for diagnosing various retinal diseases such as *Normal*, *Drusen*, *Cataract*, and *Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)*. By leveraging **DenseNet** and transfer learning, this project aims to accurately classify OCT images into relevant categories.

## **Dataset**

The **Retinal OCT dataset** used in this project contains images categorized into the following classes:
1. **Normal**  
2. **Drusen**  
3. **Cataract**  
4. **DME**  

### **Preprocessing**:
- Image resizing to a consistent resolution (e.g., 224x224).
- Normalization of pixel values.
- Splitting into **train**, **validation**, and **test** sets.

## **Model Architecture**

The project uses **DenseNet** (Dense Convolutional Network), a deep learning model that connects each layer to every other layer to improve feature reuse and reduce overfitting.

- **Key Features**:
  - Pre-trained DenseNet model (e.g., DenseNet121 on ImageNet) for transfer learning.
  - Custom classification head to match the number of classes (softmax activation).
  - Optimization using **Adam Optimizer**.
  - Use of **EarlyStopping** and **ModelCheckpoint** callbacks for better training control.
